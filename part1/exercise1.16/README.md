# EXERCISE 1.16: CLOUD DEPLOYMENT

It is time to wrap up this part and run a containerized app in the cloud.

You can take any web-app, eg. an example or exercise from this part, your own app, or even the course material (see [devopsdockeruh/coursepage](https://hub.docker.com/r/devopsdockeruh/coursepage)) and deploy it to some cloud provider.

There are plenty of alternatives, and most provide a free tier. Here are some alternatives that are quite simple to use:

- [fly.io](https://fly.io) (easy to use but needs a credit card even in the free tier)
- [render.com](https://render.com) (bad documentation, you most likely need google)
- [heroku.com](https://heroku.com) (has a free student plan through [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://www.heroku.com/github-students))

If you know a good cloud service for the purposes of this exercise, please tell us (yes, we know about Amazon AWS, Google Cloud and Azure already... ).

Submit the Dockerfile, a brief description of what you did, and a link to the running app.
