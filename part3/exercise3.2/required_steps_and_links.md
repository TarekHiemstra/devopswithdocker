# EXERCISE 3.2: A DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE TO A CLOUD SERVICE

## What I did
In [https://github.com/TarekHiemstra/react-hn-docker/settings/secrets/actions](https://github.com/TarekHiemstra/react-hn-docker/settings/secrets/actions) I had to add 4 repository secrets:
* DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
* DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
* RENDER_API_KEY
* RENDER_SERVICE_ID

To deploy to Render I used a ready-made GitHub Action, found here [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-render](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-render)

I tested it and it works.
