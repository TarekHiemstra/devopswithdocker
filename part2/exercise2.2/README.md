# EXERCISE 2.2

Read about how to add the command to docker-compose.yml from the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#command).

The familiar image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` can be used to start a web service, see the [exercise 1.10](../../part1/exercise1.10)

Create a docker-compose.yml, and use it to start the service so that you can use it with your browser.

Submit the docker-compose.yml, and make sure that it works simply by running `docker compose up`
