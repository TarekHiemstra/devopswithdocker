# MANDATORY EXERCISE 2.3

  As we saw previously, starting an application with two programs was not trivial and the commands got a bit long.

  In the [previous part](../../part1) we created Dockerfiles for both [frontend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend) of the example application. Next, simplify the usage into one docker-compose.yml.

  Configure the backend and frontend from [part 1 exercise 1.12 - 1.14](../../part1) to work in Docker Compose.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml
