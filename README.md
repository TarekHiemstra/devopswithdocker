# <center>DevOps with Docker</center>

This course provides an introduction to container technologies, with a particular focus on Docker and container orchestration using Docker Compose. Containers are a lightweight, portable way to package and deploy software applications. Throughout the course, we'll explore the various components of web services, such as reverse proxies and databases, and how they can be deployed using Docker.
